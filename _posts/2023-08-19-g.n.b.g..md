---------------------------
This is the second game prototype I've created with the Construct 3 engine. It is designed to serve as, either as a mini-game within larger titles (akin to Pazaak in Knights of the New Republic or Gwent in Witcher 3) or as an accessible betting game  for casinos, after several fine-tuned adjustments for casino needs.

What I've carried out on creating this prototype:

- Gameplay Design 
- Mechanics Design 
- Event Scripting
- Basic Art and Sound Design
