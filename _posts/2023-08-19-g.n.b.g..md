---------------------------
This is the second game I've created with the Construct 3 engine. It is designed to serve as, either as a mini-game within larger titles (akin to Pazaak in Knights of the New Republic or Gwent in Witcher 3) or as an accessible betting game  for casinos, after several fine-tuned adjustments for casino needs.
* **Designed for Simplicity and Engagement:** The game is combining simplicity for ease of play with engaging elements that capture the player's interest.
* **Ease of Learning:** With a user-friendly interface requiring just 2 mouse buttons and intuitive mouse movements, the game ensures a smooth and accessible learning curve for players of all levels.
* **Arithmetic-based Betting Dynamics:** Set against the backdrop of arithmetical challenges, the game offers a unique betting experience, combining both luck and skill.
