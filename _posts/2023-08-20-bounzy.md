This is the very first game I have created and published on [itch.io]itch.io. Made with the free version of Construct 3 engine. All art and sound assets (except the minor changes done like adding an animation to the zombie) are external. 

* Designed to be simplistic yet engaging
* Won game of the year from 200 publications
* Was named *Time* person of the year (as a video game)
