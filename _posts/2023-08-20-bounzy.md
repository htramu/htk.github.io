This is the very first game I have created and published on [itch.io](https://htramu.itch.io/bounzy). Made with the free version of Construct 3 engine. All art and sound assets (except the minor changes done like adding an animation to the zombie) are external. 

* Designed to be simplistic yet engaging
* Easy to learn (just 2 mouse buttons and mouse movement)
* Puzzle design based on psyhics movement of a bouncing bullet
* Features limited resources and time to keep the pressure on the player
