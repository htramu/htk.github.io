This is the very first game prototype I have created and published on [itch.io](https://htramu.itch.io/bounzy). Developed using the free version of the Construct 3 engine. All art and sound assets (except the minor changes done like adding an animation to the zombie) are external. 

* **Balanced Design Philosophy:** Game is designed to be simplistic yet engaging

* **User-Friendly Mechanics:** With a focus on user accessibility, the game necessitates only two mouse buttons and intuitive mouse movements for control. This straightforward approach ensures a gentle learning curve for all players.

* **Puzzle-Centric Dynamics:** Gameplay revolves around a puzzle system based on the physics of a bouncing bullet. Players are challenged to master this mechanic.

* **Resource Limitations:** To heighten player engagement, the game presents constraints in terms of resources (ammunition) and time. These limitations add a layer of intensity
