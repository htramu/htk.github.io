This is the second jam I've submitted; it was made for the [Scream Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/scream-jam-2023), where I decided to enter alone rather than in a team. The overall theme for the jam was "Horror" and the jam ran for a week long.

Game was created using the free version of the Construct 3 engine and heavily utilizes blend modes and the Shadowlight plugin to create an enveloping darkness effect around the player. 

What I've carried out in this jam are:

- Gameplay Design 
- Mechanics Design 
- Level Design
- Event Scripting
- Basic Art and Sound Design
- Basic JavaScript Coding 

All art and sound assets, except for sprites like the map and inventory screen, logos, etc., are from external sources.
