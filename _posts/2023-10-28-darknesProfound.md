---------------------------

This game was made for the **[Scream Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/scream-jam-2023)**, where I decided to enter alone rather than in a team. The overall theme for the jam was "Horror" and the jam ran for a week long. Game was created using the free version of the Construct 3 engine and heavily utilizes blend modes and the Shadowlight plugin to create an enveloping darkness effect around the player. 

What I've designed and created in this game are:

  * Designed a top-down view shooter, with slow movement, limited ammo and health. 
  * Crafted player avatar gameplay mechanics - health, movement speed, shooting, animations 
  * Created a darkness system, only to be pierced with player torchlight. Darkness is meant to be so thick, it swallows everything (hence the dissappering of the objects on the game world).
  * Developed an inventory system, showing current ammo, health, objective status and a world map to guide the player
  * Implemented enemy mechanics (health, LoS, movement speed etc.)
  * Added three different endings depending of objective completion
  * Designed UI, "escape" menu, ending screens
  * Implemented a autosave system - where player can increase save slots by finding lesser objective items
  * Done basic art, sound and music design
  * Scripted world events such as autosave triggers
  * Coded several mechanics in basic JavaScript - movement, enemy LoS checks, torch mechanics, objective status etc.

All art and sound assets, except for sprites like the map and inventory screen, logos, etc., are from external sources.
