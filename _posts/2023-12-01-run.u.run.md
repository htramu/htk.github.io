This is a submission for [GDFG TEAM JAM #3](https://itch.io/jam/gdfg-team-jam-3), developed using the Godot 4 engine. The overall theme for the game jam was "one-time use" and the jam ran for a month.

Our team consisted of five people, including me.

My primary responsibility was level design.

In addition to my primary duty, I undertook the following tasks:

*  Scripting and Coding:
    * Implemented power-ups.
    * Created a dash system for the player.
    * Added double-jump functionality.
    * Addressed an issue where enemies would move toward the player immediately after the game started, rather than when player is in close proximity.
    * Established a player lives system (partially functional).
    * Developed player death mechanics.
    * Integrated a stopwatch function.
    * Designed a score system.
*  Incorporated 3D models created by the team's 3D artist.
*  Tweaked and tuned gameplay variables such as player speed, jump height, enemy LoS. etc.
*  Created (using https://sfxr.me/) and implemented basic sounds to jump and double jump.
*  Crafted the main menu.
*  Created the basic (HUD) elements that players see during gameplay.
*  Finished and published the game to the Itch.io
