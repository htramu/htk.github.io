This is a submission for [Easter Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/easter-jam-2024), developed using the Unity (2022.3.22f1) engine. The overall theme for the game jam was "hunting" and the jam ran for a week. The game aimed to be a 3rd person 3D auditory hunting game, where the player follows audio cues of animals and catches them with a rhythm mini-game.

Our team consisted of ten people, including me.

My primary responsibility was Game Design along with the role of the Director.

The tasks I undertook can be can be grouped as follows:
