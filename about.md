                I am a hobbyist game designer aiming for a professional game design job. 
                I love working as a systems designer and gameplay mechanics designer, 
                but as an indie gamedev, I am exposed to level design, coding, writing, 
                UI design, sound and music design and art.
            </p>
			<p>On this portfolio site, you can find the **[game design work](https://htramu.github.io/)** I've done so far, my professional  **[resume](https://htramu.github.io/resume/)**, a  **[blog](https://htramu.github.io/resume/)** about my game design ramblings and some   **[other stuff](https://htramu.github.io/resume/)** too.
