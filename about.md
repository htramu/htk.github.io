				Hello!
			</p>
            <p>
				My name is Halil, and I am a passionate game designer with a focus on systems and gameplay mechanics, eager to transition from hobbyist to a professional game design role. Also, my experience as an indie game dev has also exposed me to various disciplines like level design, coding, writing, UI/UX, and even sound and music design.
            </p>

				This portfolio site showcases my game design work both personal projects and collaborations. You'll find detailed descriptions, visual assets, and playable prototypes. Additionally, I've included my resume highlighting my skills, education and job experiences, a blog where I share my thoughts and insights on game design, and some other stuff.
