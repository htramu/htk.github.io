				Hey!
			</p>
            <p>
                I am Halil, a hobbyist game designer aiming for a professional game design job. 
                I love working as a systems designer and gameplay mechanics designer, 
                but as an indie gamedev, I am exposed to level design, coding, writing, 
                UI design, sound and music design and art.
            </p>

				On this portfolio site, you can find the game design work I've done so far, my resume,a blog about my game design ravings and some other stuff too.
