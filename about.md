                I am a hobbyist game designer aiming for a professional game design job. 
                I love working as a systems designer and gameplay mechanics designer, 
                but as an indie gamedev, I am exposed to level design, coding, writing, 
                UI design, and art.
            </p>
			<p>On this portfolio site, you can find the game design work I've done so far, my professional resume, blog about my game design ramblings and some other stuff too.
