### Beyond Difficulty: Examining the Design Flaws of the Vice City's Demolition Man

The infamous Demolition Man mission in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City has caused many players to quit the game due to its notorious difficulty. But is the challenge the only issue, or are there game design mistakes by the developers? Let’s find out. 

***(Warning! Grand Theft Auto: Vice City spoilers beyond this point.)***

This mission is the second given by Avery Carrington. It requires the player to control a remote-controlled helicopter, delivering four demolition charges to specific locations within a construction site in 7 minutes. Alongside the time limit, hazards include melee weapon-wielding enemies and pistol users. The gameplay area is confined by walls, stairs, and safety nets, leaving little room for maneuvering. Objectives are placed vertically on a four-story construction site, forcing the player to make several back-and-forth journeys to the starting point to pick up bombs, as the helicopter can only carry one at a time. With multiple hazards, a time limit, and blockers, this mission is intentionally designed to be challenging. There is no game design mistake here; it is simply a very difficult mission.

So, the design issues are not related to the mission itself. Let’s address them:

Firstly, there is an issue related to PC players. It is evident that this mission is designed to be played with a gamepad, as the developers prioritized console versions and their control schemes. Without rumble pads and with the awkward keyboard control scheme of the PC version, this mission became even more challenging. Also, it should be remembered that, when Vice City was released in 2002, gamepads were not a common accesory in PC gaming.

Secondly, there is a concern about the timing of the mission's appearance. Depending on your playstyle, this mission can be encountered very early in the game, around the 9th or 10th mission. With the skills required to handle this mission, it should have appeared later in the game, perhaps as the 40th mission or so (Vice City offers a total of 59 missions).

Thirdly, the most significant issue is that this mission is not mandatory to finish the game; it is optional and required only for 100% completion. However, this information is not relayed to the player. There is no indication anywhere, in any form, like a different marker on the map compared to the usual Grand Theft Auto mission style or a message in the briefing. Even worse, after the Cop Land mission, no other markings will be left except the “A” letter of this mission (assuming the player undertook all initial story missions). To make the game progress further, the player should buy assets and complete their respective missions in order for the main story missions to reappear. This information is only mentioned once in the ending cutscene of the Shakedown mission as if it's an optional feature. Avery's phone call after the Shakedown mission hints at it slightly, but no other information or guidance is provided to the player. It is easy to assume that, without passing this mission, the story would not continue. Many people must have given up in frustration[^1], thinking the game is stuck. This is a significant design mistake; the game should have clearly advertised the direction to the player.
